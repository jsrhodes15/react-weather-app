// This action is taking advantage of 'Redux-Promise' to handle a promise that
// we received while using Axios -we used Axios to make our Ajax request.
// This middleware that we used was especially helpful because it automatically
// detected that we provided a 'payload' of a Promise. It stopped that action,
// waited for the promise to resolve. Once the promise resolved, it took the data
// coming back from the request, stuck it on the 'payload' property, and sent
// the action on to all of the reducers in our application.
// This allows us to not have to worry about Promises or callbacks for async actions.
